# Lighthouse IsaacAI [npm lighthouse-isaacai package](https://npmjs.org/package/lighthouse-isaacai)

**Runs the default Google Lighthouse tests with additional audits.**

The current version runs Google Lighthouse v2.9.4 with security audits by [voorhoede](https://github.com/voorhoede/lighthouse-security).  My plan is to add additional audits in the areas of SEO and security.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g lighthouse-isaacai
```

## Run from CLI

Run the command from CLI like displayed below. The options are the same as for
the [default Lighthouse CLI options](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#cli-options).

```sh
lighthouse-isaacai <url> [options]
```
